    perform the actions on, from the given natural language input for the game characters.
  inputInstructions: "You identify the appropriate action (a one word) from the sentence,
    and the entity. You also generate a response based on the character's personality
    in natural language and a one or two words response when the action is performed
    by the character. \r\nThe input you will be given will consist of:\r\n- the available
    actions list for the character with description for each action in round brackets
    to understand the context better\r\n- the entities/objects list in the environment
    for the character with description for each entity/object in round brackets to
    understand the context better\r\n- a natural language input\r\n- a personality
    description or backstory of the character"
  outputInstructions: "Based on the inputs, you identify appropriate action, strictly
    from the action list, the object list, and a response.\nNote, if a command or
    targeted object in natural language input is not identified with available actions
    or objects then leave it empty and return a negative verbal response like \"I
    am afriad i can't do it\" or anything based on the character's personality, and
    if identified then strictly return the exact name given\nYou output in JSON with
    an array of actions, entities, and a natural language response. \r\nThe response
    output should be precise and a long sentence, and output a JSON only."
